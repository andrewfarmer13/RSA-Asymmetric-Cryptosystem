# RSA-Asymmetric-Cryptosystem
Asymmetric cryptosystems are essential for cybersecurity in today’s internet age. An asymmetric cryptosystem consists of a public key available for anyone to encrypt a message. However, it requires the private key to decrypt the ciphered text. To ensure security, it is computationally hard to find the private key from a provided public key. This project will be a  developed prototype of RSA with simple applications. Acknowledging the existence of an RSA module already, this project was developed for the purpose of gaining a greater understanding of how RSA works.
